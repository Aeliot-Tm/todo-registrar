## How to contribute to TODO Registrar

#### Did you find a bug?

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in TODO Registrar**,
  and instead send email to 5785276@gmail.com.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Aeliot-Tm/todo-registrar/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Aeliot-Tm/todo-registrar/issues/new/choose).
  Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample**
  or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality,
or testability of TODO Registrar will generally not be accepted.

#### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

* Suggest your change as a [feature request](https://github.com/Aeliot-Tm/todo-registrar/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&projects=&template=3_FEATURE_REQUEST.md),
  read about [local development](docs/local_development.md) and start writing code.
