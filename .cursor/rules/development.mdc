Follow these rules when developing:

1. Stack:
   - PHP 8.2+
   - Symfony Console 7.4 (CLI application)
   - Symfony Dependency Injection 7.4 (DI container, services configuration)
   - Symfony Config 7.4 (configuration loading)
   - Symfony Finder (file search)
   - Symfony YAML (YAML config parsing)
   - Guzzle HTTP 7.9 (HTTP client)
   - knplabs/github-api 3.14 (GitHub Issues API)
   - m4tthumphrey/php-gitlab-api 11.14 (GitLab Issues API)
   - lesstif/php-jira-rest-client 5.8 (JIRA API)
   - PHPStan 2.0 (static analysis)
   - PHP CS Fixer (code formatting)
   - Box (PHAR building)

2. When changing existing classes, try to use file renaming (`git mv`)
   instead of creating new ones and deleting old ones where possible.

3. Write all comments in code and everything that is output to logs or console in English.

4. Nether use comments like `@phpstan-ignore-next-line` which suppress issues detected by PHPStan.

5. Do not add more than ONE blank line in a row in any files (.php, .yaml and so on).
   Maximum 1 blank line to separate logical blocks.

6. Do not create new documentation files without an explicit request.

7. Project runs in Docker containers configured in `compose.yaml`.
   To execute shell scripts, add prefix `docker compose exec php-cli ` to them.

8. After creating or updating *.php files, at the end of the work run these shell scripts:
   1. PHP CS Fixer: `composer cs-fix`
   2. PHPStan: `composer phpstan`
