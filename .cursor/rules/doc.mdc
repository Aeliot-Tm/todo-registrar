Download descriptions from files IF you need to understand the work:
1. Architecture (Technical solutions):
   - [Overview](../docs/API/Architecture/Overview.md)
   - [Processing Flow](../docs/API/Architecture/ProcessingFlow.md)

2. Features:
   - [GitHub Registrar](../docs/API/Feature/GitHubRegistrar.md)
   - [GitLab Registrar](../docs/API/Feature/GitLabRegistrar.md)
   - [JIRA Registrar](../docs/API/Feature/JIRARegistrar.md)
   - [Redmine Registrar](../docs/API/Feature/RedmineRegistrar.md)
   - [Yandex Tracker Registrar](../docs/API/Feature/YandexTrackerRegistrar.md)

When updating functionality or when explicitly requested, update the corresponding documentation files.
   - First, business logic/steps with minimal technical details, then additional logic with minimal technical details,
     and finally, technical details (architecture, paths, settings, commands, etc.).
   - Update without blocks with the latest changes, as if you were doing it from scratch for complete documentation.
   - Keep documentation of Architecture (Technical solutions) in directory [Architecture](../docs/API/Architecture) and add path to such file
     in section `1. Architecture (Technical solutions):` above like others.
   - Keep documentation of Features in directory [Feature](../docs/API/Feature) and add path to such file in section `2. Features:` above like others.

When creating new documentation files:
   - After creating a new Architecture documentation file, add a link to it in section `1. Architecture (Technical solutions):` above.
     Format: `- [Description](../docs/API/Architecture/[FileName].md)` (Markdown links format).
   - After creating a new Feature documentation file, add a link to it in section `2. Features:` above.
     Format: `- [Description](../docs/API/Feature/[FileName].md)` (Markdown links format).
   - Use relative paths from this file (starting with `../docs/`).
   - Keep entries in alphabetical order by description for better organization.
